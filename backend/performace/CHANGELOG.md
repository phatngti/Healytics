## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file, to track implementation progress

### Removed
- Cleared 11 test-case modules from `locustfiles/` — these were placeholder stubs based on an earlier API contract and need to be rewritten against the current backend
  - `auth_user.py`, `auth_partner.py`, `auth_admin.py`
  - `account_user.py`, `partner_profile.py`
  - `locations.py`, `employees.py`, `categories.py`
  - `products.py`, `service_tags.py`, `admin.py`
- Commented out all imports in `locustfile.py` (will be re-enabled as modules are reimplemented)

### Kept (infrastructure)
- `locustfile.py` — master entry point (imports commented out)
- `locust.conf` — default Locust settings
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies (locust, faker)
- `common/` — shared utilities (`config.py`, `auth.py`, `data_generators.py`)
- `api_docs/openapi.json` — OpenAPI specification reference
